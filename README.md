# Android-Note-Taker


Note taker is an application to take notes and was created as a demo for someone interested in Android development. 
It's a very basic application demonstrating basic data storage, material design principles, fragments and basic activity flow.

#### Travis.ci

I attempted to get Travis to work and wasn't aware that it didn't have to be in the master branch to test (coming from Bitbucket 
Pipelines where that is the defautlt). There are therefore a lot of useless commits of me trying to get Travis.ci to work. I still 
have not been successful and am currently stuck on getting the emulator to start successfully so if anyone has any tips, that'd be 
great.
